WIP Will take at least three more days before it is even testable, let alone usable. I posted early to beat procrastination

**Goal:** Allow user to write notes to their future self, which will be hidden until the time comes. Notes will be categorised by 'emotion', and can be obscured by default until the user is mentally up for reading them.

Intended Process:

1. On launch, check if any Notes are due.
2. If due, shows a carosel of the Notes.
3. Otherwise, show a new note entry panel.
