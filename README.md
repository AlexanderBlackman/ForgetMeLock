WIP Will take at least three more days before it is even testable, let alone usable. I posted early to beat procrastination

**Goal:** Allow user to write notes to their future self, which will be hidden until the time comes. Notes will be categorised by 'emotion', and can be obscured by default until the user is mentally up for reading them.  Hopefully this will be useful stopping ruminating thoughts, or acting before they are ready.

Intended Process:

1. On launch, check if any Notes are due.
2. If due, shows a carosel of the Notes, with the contents of (angry,sad, worried) notes obscured until the user clicks a button to unobscure.
3. Otherwise, show a new note entry panel, where they can write a note, state their current emotional state and give a date to hide until.
4.
